#### This repository contains a collection of NLP (Natural Language Processing) projects that I have worked on by following YouTube tutorials. These projects were originally developed and saved in Google Colab and on my local hard drive. Now, Iâ€™m making them available here for open access and sharing with the community.

## Projects Included
- **few-shot-text-classification-with-seftfi.ipynb**: A few-shot learning model for text classification.
- **Bloom7 B with PEFT & bitsandbytes and LORA.ipynb**: Fine-tuning the Bloom7 B model using PEFT, bitsandbytes, and LORA.
- **Fine_tuning_Llama2.ipynb**: Fine-tuning the Llama2 model.
- **Gemma2_9b_with_Unsloth.ipynb**: Project focusing on Gemma2 9B model with Unsloth.
- **DragGAN.ipynb**: A project exploring the DragGAN model.
- **gpt-neo-bnb_4bit_training_with_inference.ipynb**: Training and inference using the GPT-Neo model with 4-bit precision.
- **Llama_3_1_8b_-_Unsloth_2x_faster_finetuning.ipynb**: Faster fine-tuning of Llama 3.1b model with Unsloth.
- **macaw-multi-angle-question-answering-model.ipynb**: Multi-angle question answering using the Macaw model.
- **Mistral_Nemo_12b_Unsloth.ipynb**: Fine-tuning the Mistral 12B model using Unsloth.
